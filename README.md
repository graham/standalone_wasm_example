# standalone_wasm_example

I wrote this to better explain an issue I was seeing: https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/issues/2448

However, this example works, which means I'm doing something else wrong :)

For the best experience, view this:

https://github.com/graham/standalone_wasm_example/blob/main/src/main.rs

and then this:

https://github.com/graham/standalone_wasm_example/blob/main/client/src/lib.rs
